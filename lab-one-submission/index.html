                        <p>In print, publishers determine the size of what is displayed (and where) in absolute
                            measures.
                            When
                            the
                            internet arrived, this trend continued, and designers defined websites in pixel sizes.</p>
                        <p>For responsive design, the absolute size method doesn't work because devices vary in size.
                            Therefore,
                            responsive design uses relative sizes.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>When you use fluid grids to define a layout using relative values (such as percentages),
                            nothing
                            on a
                            layout
                            will
                            have a constant size across all devices. This means that images in your layout will need to
                            be
                            resized
                            for
                            each
                            screen real estate. That's where fluid images enter the picture! Much like water, fluid
                            images
                            take
                            on
                            the
                            size
                            of their container. So, you can create a single image and instruct the browser to scale the
                            image
                            according
                            to
                            the size of the container.</p>

                <h2>Media Queries</h2>

                        <p>Media queries are instructions to alter the site's layout based on certain conditions. For
                            example, a
                            two-column
                            approach might not be practical in the screen real estate of a smartphone.</p>
                        <p>You can use a media query to instruct the browser to rearrange the screen real estate if the
                            screen
                            size
                            is
                            smaller than a particular size. This specific size at which the layout breaks is called a
                            “breakpoint.”
